# Word Weaver

A personal Natural Language Processing (NLP) project implemented in Python. This repository includes code and resources for text analysis, preprocessing, and various NLP tasks, crafted and maintained by me as a personal project.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Customizable pipeline for additional NLP tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satya12345678-bot/Word-Weaver.git
cd Word-Weaver
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the main script to perform text preprocessing and analysis. For example, to analyze an input text file and get sentiment classification results:

```bash
python nlp_proj_code.py --input data/input.txt --output results/output.txt --task sentiment
```

- `--input`: Path to the input text file (one document per line).
- `--output`: Path to the output file where results will be written.
- `--task`: NLP task to perform (`sentiment`, `classification`, or `preprocess`).

## Example

Suppose you have an input file at `data/input.txt` with the following contents:

```
I love using NLP for text analysis!
This product was terrible and I will not recommend it.
```

Run the following command:

```bash
python nlp_proj_code.py --input data/input.txt --output results/output.txt --task sentiment
```

The output file at `results/output.txt` might look like:

```
Input: I love using NLP for text analysis!
Sentiment: Positive

Input: This product was terrible and I will not recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative
```

## Project Structure

- `nlp_proj_code.py` – Main code file implementing NLP functionalities
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies required
- `data/` – Input data files (if applicable)
- `results/` – Output/results (if applicable)
